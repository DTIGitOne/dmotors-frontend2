## ABOUT
This is the frontend for the car market selling website. This is my biggest completed website that i have built. The backend and the frontend have both been created by me, this was my first really big project that i have made and the first project that i have made after 
really learning to work with react (hence all of the missing comments on the code because of how my experenice at the time of developing this). It has a lot of functionlities as: Signup, User email verification, Login, Forgot Password, Profile Inspection, Profile Editing,
Listing Creation, Delete Listing, User Settings, User account deletion, Reviews, Recommended, Search Paremeters, Vehicle Details page, Admin panel for users, Admin user profile editing and a few more little functionalities. The whole project was made in 3 weeks which i was happy with beacuse it was my first time coding backend and learning it at the same time as making this which came out good, and designing and developing the frontend in the same time period as well.
